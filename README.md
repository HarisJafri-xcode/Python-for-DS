# Python-for-Data-Science
A structured, public code hub for my “Python for Data Science” teaching materials. Organized by topic: Core Python, NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn. Each folder contains Google Colab notebooks used in my lectures and practice sessions, plus datasets and helper utilities where needed. Students can open any notebook directly in Colab.
