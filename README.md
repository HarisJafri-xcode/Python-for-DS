# Python for Data Science — Course Notebooks

This repository hosts all notebooks created for my **Python for Data Science** course.  
Each topic folder contains Google Colab notebooks that can be opened and run directly in the browser.

## Topics
- 01-Core-Python  
- 02-NumPy  
- 03-Pandas  
- 04-Scikit-Learn  
- 05-Datasets  
- 06-Utils  

## How to Use
1. Pick a topic and notebook.  
2. Click the “Open in Colab” badge at the top of the notebook.  
3. If a dataset is needed, it will be available in the `05-Datasets` folder.

## Conventions
- Two-digit numeric prefixes keep lessons in order.  
- Lowercase with underscores for notebook names.  
- One notebook per lesson folder.
